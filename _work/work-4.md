I was part of Quantitative Morphogenesis Lab, IBBME, UofT from Fall 2014 to Summer 2015. 
I analyzed mathematical models of Drosophila Melanogasterâ€™s embryonic development with graduate students under the supervision of  Dr. Rodrigo Fernandez-Gonzalez.
Funded by NSERC Undergraduate Summer Research Award, I developed and designed a graphical user interface for SIESTA, an image analysis platform used for analysis of time-lapse microscopy data in biological developmental processes. Project poster was presented in Undergraduate Engineering Research Day (UnERD).
