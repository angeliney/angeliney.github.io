Under the supervision of Dr. P.C. Chan, I supported lab pathologists in their day to day tasks, and worked on data analysis for a project on Bisalbuminemia.
The project was later published in Journal of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine. I also put together a few  e-learning modules for nurses.
