Hi there! I am currently pursuing a Master degree in Computer Science, University of Toronto. 
My research interests revolve around how to properly incorporate machine learning in real applications. 
I'm interested in investigating underlying bias in datasets, causal inference, building a fair model, and
working with time-series data.
