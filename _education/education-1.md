Computer Science (current, projected 2020)

My Master studies mainly focus on machine learning and its application to healthcare data. I've taken classes and done projects in:
* Machine Learning for Health
* Deep Reinforcement Learning
* Algorithms for Private Data Analysis
* Probabilistic Learning and Reasoning

In the beginning of my Master study, I was privileged to co-chair the first UofT Undergraduate Research in Computer Science Conference 2018 and awarded Vector Scholarship in Artificial Intelligence.
I was also part of the Undergraduate Committee for Fall 2018.
