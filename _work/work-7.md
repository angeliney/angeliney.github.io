I joined Dr. Anna Goldenberg's lab in Summer 2017 and continued to stay for my senior undergraduate thesis and Master degree. 
In Summer 2017, I worked on finding association of genes with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) with predicted gene expression from genomic data (eQTL).
I further applied this method to find predisposition genes to cancers. 
My current work focuses on application of machine learning in clinical health data. 
I'm currently working on building a diabetes risk predictor for liver transplant recipients under the supervision of Dr. Goldenberg and Dr. Mamatha Bhat.
